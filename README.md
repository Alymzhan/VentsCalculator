# Vents Calculator
## Description
Small project was created as task for interview. 
It should read dimenssions of cart (ice cream cart) and show maximum possible numbers of vents and space between them as result.


## Task:
 A local ice cream vendor, Briqs, is looking to open up an ice cream cart downtown. The
 owner recently purchased a cart to house his soft serve machine but the cart does not
 have enough venting in it, and is constantly overheating.  Because of this, his ice cream is melting and his customers
 are going to the other ice cream stands.
 
 In order to help regain his business, he needs to add vents to his cart but he can't
 decide how many to use. He wants to add as many 4-inch wide by 1-inch tall vents 
 along the front of his cart as possible, but also wants them to be evenly spaced. 
 The minimum spacing between vents is 1 inch.
 
 Given the width and height of the cart, give the following details:
    - the maximum number of vents
    - the spacing of the vents
